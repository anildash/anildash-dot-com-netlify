I struggled for a long time when the nice folks at the [Heat Rocks podcast](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/heat-rocks) asked me which Prince album I’d want to talk about on their show. Oliver Wang and Morgan Rhodes run an amazing podcast, where every episode is a deep-dive into a classic album.

Ultimately, because of its significance and relative lack of prominence amongst casual fans, I settled on Prince’s 1982 classic, *1999*. In the finished show, we talk about everything from how Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson were influenced by the sound of *1999* to my own personal revelations about faith, as inspired by discovering that Prince didn’t actually write the Lord’s Prayer.

If you ain’t busy for the next 45 minutes, please do check out this [wonderful conversation](http://www.maximumfun.org/heat-rocks/heat-rocks-ep-7-anil-dash-princes-1999-1982)!
