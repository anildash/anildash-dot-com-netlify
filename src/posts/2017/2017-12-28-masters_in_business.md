A few months ago, I got the wonderful opportunity to talk to Barry Ritholtz, who’s best known as a Bloomberg View columnist and for his excellent “Masters in Business” podcast, but whom I’ve known online for many years.

We talked about a topic that’s incredibly important to me, the ethical challenges facing all of us who create technology. It’s a wide-ranging conversation that’s over an hour long, but I hope you’ll take the time to listen, as this is a discussion we all need to be engaging in.

There’s also a [longer story in the BloombergView site](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-02/-making-the-tech-world-more-humane-and-ethical) covering a bit of what we discussed.
