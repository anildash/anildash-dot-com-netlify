Developer relations and tech evangelism is one of those fields that just doesn’t get enough respect. Having done the work for years myself, I think it’s a wildly under-examined field and very few businesses do enough to properly invest in this critical part of the tech ecosystem.

That’s why it was a real thrill to get to [guest on the Community Pulse show](http://communitypulse.io/anil-dash/), discussing exactly these topics. I hope you’ll give it a look.
