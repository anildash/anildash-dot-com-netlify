I was delighted to get to talk to Ben Greenman for an episode of “Dig If You Will The Podcast,” his series in honor of his book “Dig If You Will The Picture”. We go deep into Prince’s influence on transforming the music industry, and if you like it, you should [check out Ben’s book](http://amzn.to/2g3hPje), too.

Oh, and of course, we talk about [my favorite floppy of all time](/2014/06/my-favorite-floppy-of-all-time.html) — the disc Prince sent out with a custom font when he changed his name to his famous unpronounceable symbol.
