So, yeah, [Jason](http://q.queso.com/2001/05/31) is the proud host of [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com) now, and, through the magic of **QuesoVision**, you can watch him set up the MeFi box here in New York in [vibrant, living color](https://cdn.glitch.global/71e5579f-aba0-499a-b200-01549a2a80ce/quesovision.gif?v=1729991559643).

There’s something surreal about watching someone a mile away set up a computer that was shipped across a continent. I just regret that I couldn’t have been there to plug the thing in myself. I will definitely go and visit soon. And Jason, take your coffee off of the machine, okay?
