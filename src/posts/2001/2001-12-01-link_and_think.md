**Link and Think:**

[![Link and Think](https://cdn.glitch.global/71e5579f-aba0-499a-b200-01549a2a80ce/linkandthink.gif?v=1730089609457)](http://www.linkandthink.org/)

Last year, the most useful, most poignant, and most resonant links on World AIDS Day were on [MetaFilterâ€™s Day Without Weblogs page](http://www.metafilter.com/dww.mefi). I am expecting the same will be true this year, so [join the community](http://www.metafilter.com/linkandthink.mefi) in remembrance, observance, and education.
