While cruising around voting for various Webbys, I realized that some ratings schemes **don’t translate well**, particularly in [this category](http://www.webbyawards.com/peoplesvoice/category_ballot.html?catID=24)…

Because [this screen ](https://cdn.glitch.global/71e5579f-aba0-499a-b200-01549a2a80ce/mahir1.gif?v=1729991452992) and [this screen](https://cdn.glitch.global/71e5579f-aba0-499a-b200-01549a2a80ce/mahir2.gif?v=1729991453460) seem just plain absurd to me. **No offense, Mahir.**
