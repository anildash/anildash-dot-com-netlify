I’d been playing with a [redesign concept](/stuff/redesign.html) a few months ago that I never got around to finishing, so I thought I’d put it up for comments from all of you, and perhaps one of you clever folks can figure out why the sidebar links move around in Internet Explorer on Windows. Please be kind, I’m no designer…
