Guess I should’ve seen it coming:

[![Clicks is closing](/anil/stuff/clicksclosing_thumb.jpg)](/anil/stuff/clicksclosing.jpg)

The camera shop I mentioned a [few days ago](/2003/05/08/digital_cameras) has apparently had its last day in business. Perhaps the signs decrying the onslaught of digital photography were a bitter lashing out at the forces that were ending the business. Or a bit of dark humor since they knew of their impending closure. Either way, it’s probably a fairly telling sign of what happens to those who would aspire to turn back the clock in the face of progress.
