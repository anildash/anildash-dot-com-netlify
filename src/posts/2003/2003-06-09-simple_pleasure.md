One of the best things about my job is that I get to go to conferences, meet interesting people, and then watch all their wifi-enabled laptops’ screens turn blue-and-gray as they all log into their Movable Type screens so they can blog the event.

Makes me feel like I’m doing work that people actually appreciate.
