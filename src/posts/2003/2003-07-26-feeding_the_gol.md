[Amazon has syndication feeds](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/xs/syndicate.html/002-6631521-1939226)? So what? The current version inspires a big yawn. I don’t want to subscribe to a category of products, I want to subscribe to my [Gold Box](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/static/-/goldbox/index/2020-20/). It’s a well-defined list of items, updated on a regular schedule, and I want a reminder when it changes. Seems like a natural fit to me.
