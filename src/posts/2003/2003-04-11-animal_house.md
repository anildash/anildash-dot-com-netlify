Sometime early this morning, I realized that the dog was on one side of me growling and the cat was on the other side of me purring, and both of their low rumbles were at almost exactly the same frequency. I’m no expert on resonance or the auditory conductivity of bone structures, but I’m pretty sure they were trying to make my skull explode. Damn animals.
