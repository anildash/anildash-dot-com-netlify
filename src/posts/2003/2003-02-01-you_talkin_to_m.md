So tonight, while we were walking around in Chelsea, I swore that someone shouted my name at my from across the street, but I didn’t see anybody. I’m too lazy for a "missed connections" Craig’s List post, especially if it’s someone that knows my name. So [lemme know](mailto:anil@dashes.com?i%20saw%20you) if it was you I missed running into.
