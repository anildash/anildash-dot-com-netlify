Hey, how many companies let you make macaca jokes and say whatever stupid thing you want on their official website? Well, *my employer does*! [Check out the podcast](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/11/six_apart_podcast.html) that Mena, Byrne, and I recorded, because I think it’s far more enjoyable than it really has any reason to be.
