One of the great, definitive abbreviations for the social web is TL;DR. It stands for [too long; didn’t read](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR), and epitomizes the short-attention-span crowd, the willfully idiotic segment of the online population that 1. we all sometimes belong to and that 2. makes for the shittiest experiences on the web.

The TL;DR impulse is both the engine behind and the scourge of the web communities. I’m reminded of this fact because a conversation with an acquaintance referenced Jay Rosen’s [Bloggers vs. Journalists is Over](http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/01/21/berk_essy.html), in the context of my own [The Blog Cycle](/2005/03/21/the_blog_cycle). Jay Rosen, of course, is one of the smartest and most far-seeing experts on the intersection of blogs and journalism. He’s also the definitive creator of TL;DR content: It’s so smart, so dense, and so lengthy that I wonder if even *he* has ever read to the end of one of his own blog posts.

There are a million manifestations of this delightful demon; It popped up for me when I realized that a recent New York Times story had some fairly significant revelations about a company in the tech industry. The news wasn’t anything revelatory, but I had assumed the information would spark a number of startled blog posts on highly trafficked sites. The next day, though, silence! Why had everybody ignored the big story? The answer was obvious: The key quotes were tucked away towards the end of a 1,000 word article. If you ever want to hide some information from prying eyes, I’d suggest offering it to the New York Times.

The final beauty of TL;DR is of course the fact that it’s an abbreviation at all. Spelling out the concept would of course take too long to read.
