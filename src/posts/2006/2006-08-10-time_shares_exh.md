[![Time Shares](https://cdn.glitch.global/71e5579f-aba0-499a-b200-01549a2a80ce/timeshares.png?v=1730095302483)](http://www.rhizome.org/events/timeshares/)

I’m flattered, somewhat amazed, and more than a little amused to point out that I’m part of [Time Shares](http://www.rhizome.org/events/timeshares/), a series of online exhibitions presented by [Rhizome](http://www.rhizome.org/) and the [New Museum of Contemporary Art](http://newmuseum.org/). Alongside the works of geniuses like Golan Levin and Warren Sack is my own silly [Zidane World Cup Headbutt Animation Festival](/2006/07/11/zidane_world_cu).

As much as I’ve enjoyed the entertainment that people have gotten from the little clip (somewhere around a quarter of a million people have played the movie), I can’t help but feel like it’s a little unfair to have my silliness alongside some really great work. So to atone for it, I beseech you to check out [the Time Shares site](http://www.rhizome.org/events/timeshares/) and look at all the other items, each of which is pretty amazing. In the meantime, I’ll put this alongside [the wacky t-shirt hijinks](/2006/07/18/the_goatse_tshi) in my list of inappropriate appearances in places where I don’t belong.

Marisa Olson of Rhizome has a [brief description](http://rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=22581&amp;page=1#43583) of the Faultlines program that Time Shares is part of, and I can’t wait to see where the series goes next.
