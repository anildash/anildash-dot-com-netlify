It’s like the whole web was made for [Ben’s indulgence](http://btrott.typepad.com/typepad/2005/09/know_what_happe.html). This week at Slate, [Judd Apatow’s Diary](http://www.slate.com/id/2126915/entry/0/). The best part? He [loves "Being Bobby Brown"](http://www.slate.com/id/2126915/entry/2126926/), too.
