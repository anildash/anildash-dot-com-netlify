Thanks to Matt for [pointing out some wildly irresponsible journalism](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/11/google_kills_ch.html). I’m always amazed that editors go with these stories (and write these kinds of headlines!) but maybe if we shame them enough over time, they’ll tone it down. Anybody know who the editor was on this piece?
