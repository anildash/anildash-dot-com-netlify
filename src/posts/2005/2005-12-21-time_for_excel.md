If you enjoyed posts such as [Excel Pile](/2004/04/22/excel_pile), where people detailed their favorite ways of geeking out with Microsoft Excel, you may enjoy such recent discoveries such as [the drum machine worksheet](http://www.milezero.org/index.cgi/music/tools/excel/drumpad_xls_alpha.html) as well as the [LiveJournal posting client](http://brad.livejournal.com/2185677.html). Both are implemented as Excel worksheets. Both are ridiculously nerdy.
