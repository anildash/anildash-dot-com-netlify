The impressive thing isn’t that Sky News has a [Michael Jackson Trial Channel](http://www.sky.com/skynews/jackson). The impressive thing is the order of the navigation on the left side of their news website:

- Homepage
- UK
- World
- Jackson
- Business
- Money
- Showbiz
- Oscars
- Sci/Tech
- Offbeat
- Weather
- Motoring
- Travel
- Archive
- Sky Sports

I’m just glad the Jackson trial isn’t considered "sports".
