What’s that? Oh, you like my brown bracelet? Why, thank you! It signifies support for [tobacco-free colorectal and colon cancer survivors](http://www.awarenessdepot.com/Colors.html). Once the sun fades it a little, I’ll also be supporting multiple myeloma awareness!

Thanks (or no thanks) to [Jason](http://q.queso.com/archives/001604) for the link.
