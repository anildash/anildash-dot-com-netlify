Armin Wagner’s created a brilliant collection entitled [Crates and Barrels](http://www.arminbwagner.com/crates_and_barrels), cataloguing the ubiquity of these containers in video game culture. Though they’re obviously favorites in 3D games for their simplicity (hey, that’s a cube, and that’s a cylinder!), there’s something kind of pleasing about the way they cross so many genres and generations of games.

You can even get separate lists of the most recently uploaded [crates](http://medien.akbild.ac.at/armin/crates_and_barrels/screenshots/crate_new.html) and [barrels](http://medien.akbild.ac.at/armin/crates_and_barrels/screenshots/barrel_new.html).
