From the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language has a [delightful family tree of Indo-European languages](https://web.archive.org/web/20071002102951/http://www.bartleby.com/61/indoeuro.html), though I was kinda miffed at the omission of [my parentsâ€™ native tongue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriya_language).
