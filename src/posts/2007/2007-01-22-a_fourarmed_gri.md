Because this came up at work today, I’ll repost a link to [Pop Culture Addict’s look at Grimace](http://www.popcultureaddict.com/misc/grimace.htm), the terrifying/cuddly McDonald’s mascot-blob.

The key point here? **Grimace used to have four arms**. Four arms cradling dozens of milkshakes. Milkshakes that tasted like *childhood nightmares*.
