Ranjit has [made his robots play Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy”](http://www.moonmilk.com/2007/09/20/lev-and-thumpbot-play-crazy/), and in the comments reveals that apparently he can just throw *any* MIDI file at them and have it rendered in this unique theremin-and-clanking-noises arrangement. Delightful.
