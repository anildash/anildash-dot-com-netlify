Alan Leeds, one of my heroes and our greatest record of the living history of funk music, offers a [warm remembrance of Bobby Byrd](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=59289853&amp;blogID=310364391) after Byrdâ€™s passing last week. Well worth a read, especially to understand that every great sidekick had the potential to be the front man.

You might also want to revisit [Goodbye, Godfather](/2006/12/goodbye-godfather), from when we lost James Brown last year.
