In honor of my Indian heritage, but with a nod to my status as a contemporary progressive American, I’m going to create a new service that blends the best of both worlds by offering arranged same-sex marriages. There’s an Indian tradition that having a transgendered or cross-dressing man at one’s wedding is good luck, and I think this is just improving the odds. I can’t lose!
