As a lifelong supporter of the idea of private space travel, Iâ€™m so thrilled to see Burt Rutan claim the [Ansari X Prize](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/10/04/spaceshipone.attempt.cnn/index.html). Now I have to work on having hundreds of thousands of dollars to waste, and they have to work on making tickets on the rocketship a little cheaper.
