On beyond the power law, Chris Anderson’s got a [fantastic article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail_pr.html) in Wired about the importance of all the parts of culture that don’t fit in the 1% or 10% slope of the power law curve. I haven’t had a chance to give a thorough enough re-reading, but even a quick glance looks like just the story I was hoping to see after the spate of power law hand-wringing a few months back.
