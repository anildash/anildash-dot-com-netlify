Tom Watson’s take on [Dan Rather’s resignation](http://tomwatson.typepad.com/tom_watson/2004/11/rather_vs_jarvi.html) seems exactly right to me. Be careful the gloating you do and the negativity you celebrate, because they’ll be visited upon you one day. I wouldn’t expect everyone in the TV industry to celebrate the day that a network decides to take down a blogger, either.
