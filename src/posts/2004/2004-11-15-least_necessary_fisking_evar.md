I am boundlessly amused that the "bloggers fact-checking the Eye’s ass" circle-jerk has reached its nadir: [Courtesy of Poynter.org](http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=73646), two thousand and seven hundred words on [how long Placido Domingo’s longest round of applause lasted](http://www.mervinblock.com/60minutesapplause.html). I wish I could applaud this journalistic effort for the full hour and twenty minutes it takes to read it.

ASS: **FACT-CHECKED**!
