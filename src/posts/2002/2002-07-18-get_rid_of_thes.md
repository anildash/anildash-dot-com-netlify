It’s funny because it’s *true*! This list of [One Hundred Albums You Should Remove from Your Collection Immediately](http://www.jaguaro.org/feature/03-09-02_wesk.shtml) only includes 3 or 4 that I have. Overall, they are so, *so* right on.

But you’ll pry "Fear of Black Planet" out of my cold, dead hands, you sons of bitches.
