And, from the “I couldn’t make this up if I tried” category comes this bus station ad that I started seeing a few weeks ago:

[![cinderella 2](https://cdn.glitch.global/71e5579f-aba0-499a-b200-01549a2a80ce/cinderella2sm.jpg?v=1730089602717)](https://cdn.glitch.global/71e5579f-aba0-499a-b200-01549a2a80ce/cinderella2.jpg?v=1730089602368)

It just begs for a horrible subtitle. Cinderella 2: The Other Shoe Drops. Cinderella 2: After Midnight. Cinderella 2: Bibbity Bobbity *Who*?

I could do this all day. They turn into porno titles after a short while, though, don’t they?
