Shannon talks about [multiple-AIM-window conversation confusion](http://www.gringa.org/2002_01_13_archive.html#8763304), and mentions that she actually talked *about* the person she was talking *to*. I gotta say, I can’t believe I’ve never done that myself.

This is, apparently, the situation for which my favorite emoticon, Footprint-Mouth Stoner Guy, was created:
