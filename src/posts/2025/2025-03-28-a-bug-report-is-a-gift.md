Towards the end of last year, I got the delightful opportunity to talk to Scott Carey for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBzScQzZ83I-s27CEsc9c1hbTy9fbdmEH">Priority Zero podcast</a> from LeadDev. LeadDev is such a wonderfully thoughtful community for people who think about how people create with code, and who manage teams who create technology at scale. 

It's a wide-ranging conversation, and Scott was incredibly kind to indulge us covering so many topics, but I was particularly grateful to get to have the discussion at about <a href="https://youtu.be/bwkqnYQxc0A?t=2949">49:10</a> of the ways so many leaders in industry are trying to shirk responsibility, and I tried to articulate how those efforts ignore the awful, often _immoral_ level of power that's vested in the hands of business leaders. We unfortunately can see exactly how that's being abused very plainly in every aspect of our society today.
