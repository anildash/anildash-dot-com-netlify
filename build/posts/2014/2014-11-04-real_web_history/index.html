<p>There’s been precious little documentation of the real cultural impact that the social web has had, particularly in its earliest years. So it’s exciting when people in academia who are researching those topics share their findings.</p>
<p>I was sent a set of links this morning that I haven’t had a chance to read over myself yet, but for future reference, I thought they are worth sharing and recording.</p>

<li><a href="http://tawawa.org/ark/weblogs/index.html">On the emergence of blogging</a>, resources from Rudolf Ammann. “The works and fragments listed below came about in the course of my PhD thesis on the emergence of blogging, <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/108488541341988649826/albums/5794871909925183745/5794872392772316898?pid=5794872392772316898&amp;oid=108488541341988649826">submitted in October 2012</a>, successfully <a href="http://tawawa.org/ark/2013/1/21/invitation.html">defended in January 2013</a>, and currently awaiting transformation into a book.”</li>
