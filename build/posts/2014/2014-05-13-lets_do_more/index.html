<p>I’ve been trying to do more things that are unfamiliar or slightly out of my comfort zone lately. Here’s a quick roundup:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got to participate in Rhizome’s venerated <a href="http://rhizome.org/sevenonseven/">Seven on Seven</a> conference, where I teamed up with <a href="http://mccoyspace.com/">Kevin McCoy</a> to create <a href="http://www.monegraph.com/">monegraph</a>. It’s a system that uses the block chain technology which underpins Bitcoin, but puts it to work in service of artists, so that they can verify that a digital work is an original, with a verifiable provenance. I describe the context of the work in <a href="https://medium.com/message/8c7db719e495">A Bitcoin for Digital Art</a>, my first piece for Medium’s “The Message” collection, and we also showed it off with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/video/monegraph-a-cryptocurrency-for-digital-art/518221293/">a demo</a> at the most improbable of venues, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/09/monegraph/">TechCrunch</a>‘s Disrupt conference. The response overall has been great, as you can tell from the <a href="http://monegraph.tumblr.com/">monegraph tumblr</a>.</li>

<li>The White House’s working group on Big Data and Privacy <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/01/fact-sheet-big-data-and-privacy-working-group-review">released its report</a>, which is surprisingly thoughtful and appropriately nuanced in its consideration of the issues. As <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/05/01/white-house-big-data.html">danah so aptly summarized it</a>, “[T]he conversation around the “big data” phenomenon tends to get quickly polarized – it’s good or it’s bad, plain and simple. But it’s never that simple.” It’s no surprise danah’s take was so thoughtful; her <a href="http://www.datasociety.net/">Data &amp; Society Research Institute</a> was one of the most valuable contributors to the White House report. In my role on the board of the DSRI, I got to moderate a panel with <a href="http://www.katecrawford.net/">Kate Crawford</a>, <a href="http://about.me/stevenhodas">Steven Hodas</a>, <a href="http://alondranelson.com/">Alondra Nelson</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/shaminasingh">Shamina Singh</a>. The conversation was incredible, and so it’s no surprise that our panel was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf">cited in the full report</a> from the White House. You can watch the panel here:</li>

<li>Over on The Awl, it’s “<a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/05/corrupt-your-children">How to Avoid Raising a Monster</a>” which takes a look at my, uh, parenting style. This includes the question, “Can you … provide some more examples of when you’ve been especially tempted to do things that wouldn’t be found in any guidebooks on how best to raise a child?”</li>
<li>On PolicyMic, a nice piece on <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/88277/23-ways-feminism-has-made-the-world-a-better-place-for-men">23 Ways Feminism Has Made the World Better for Men</a> includes my least insightful comment ever: “Sex is fun!”</li>
<li>Coming up this fall: I’ll be <a href="http://poptech.org/rebellion">speaking at PopTech</a> in October. If you know that conference, you know why I’m geeked out about the opportunity, especially given that John Maeda as host has chosen “rebellion” as the theme for the event.</li>
<li>Oh, and Prince finally retweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/461718105841209345">one of my tweets</a>, but elided my name and then removed the tweet entirely a brief while later, as he is prone to do. But still, fun for me!</li>
<li>And as always, <a href="http://blog.thinkup.com/">the ThinkUp team has been rocking</a> with a whole range of fun and ridiculous new insights in the app. If you haven’t seen ThinkUp lately, you haven’t seen it. You should probably <a href="https://www.thinkup.com/">sign up</a> and give it a try.</li>
