<p>It’s always nice when an idea has a little bit of staying power. A few weeks ago, Yahoo Health featured a piece about <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/8-ways-to-embrace-jomo-the-joy-of-missing-out-97585805333.html">8 Ways to Embrace JOMO</a>, a reference to the “<a href="/2012/07/19/jomo/">Joy of Missing Out</a> that I wrote about a few years ago, after being inspired by Caterina on the <a href="http://caterina.net/2011/03/15/fomo-and-social-media/">Fear of Missing Out</a>. From there it bubbled up in a <a href="http://99u.com/workbook/32293/embrace-jomo-joy-of-missing-out">few places online</a>, which is a welcome contrast from most things on the web, which disappear quickly and seldom value conversations that start on personal websites.</p>

<p>As when <a href="http://www.jwt.com/blog/consumer_insights/whats-big-100-things-to-watch-in-2013">JWT’s annual list of things to watch</a> named JOMO a key concept for 2013 (and revisited the idea [in 2014](in 2014)), when it inspired <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/03/jomo-fomo-2014_n_4523544.html">more discussion</a>), I don’t think this is some particular insight on my point so much as it’s an articulation of a larger concept in culture that just didn’t have a convenient name.</p>

<p>But sometimes naming things helps us think about them. Of all the things that we could be trying to pay attention to, perhaps feeling better about our choices in spending our time wisely is the best one to be thinking about.</p>
