<p>Listen, <em>I'm</em> not the one making this assertion. It's Vulture's daily 10x10 crossword puzzle for May 17th, entitled &quot;The Sexual Tension Puzzle&quot;, in which I am, apparently, a clue. (Sorry to spoil the answer to 25 Across!)</p>
<p>Don't believe me? <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/05/crossword-the-sexual-tension-puzzle.html">Check it out for yourself</a>. Thanks so much to <a href="https://www.girlbosswords.com/about.html">Malaika Handa</a> for this delightful absurdity!</p>
