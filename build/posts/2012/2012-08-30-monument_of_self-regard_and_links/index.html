<p>I sure do like talking to people! Here’s some recent conversations:</p>
<ul>
<li>MIT Tech Review offered up <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428924/a-twitter-tweak-or-a-revolution-in-online/">A Twitter Tweak or a Revolution in Online Discourse?</a> as a look at Branch. (Where, full disclosure, I’ve graduated from unofficial advisor to slightly-more-official advisor.) I have to reject the “Best Thing Ever or Completely Meaningless?” framing of the headline, but I liked the thoughtful understanding of the history of comments online that informed the piece.</li>
<li>Oh, and speaking of Twitter (AS WE ALWAYS DO), here’s me on Bloomberg West talking about Twitter’s policy changes. TV is fun! (And Mathew Ingram <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-20/hey-twitter-shouldnt-it-be-about-the-users">wrote a little bit more about it too</a>)</li>
</ul>

<li>If you’re a regular reader of this site, you of course love animated gifs, since we’ve been <a href="/2011/07/animated-gifs-triumphant">talking about them</a> for years. The Content Strategist (that’s a real publication!) jumps into the fray with <a href="http://contently.com/blog/2012/08/29/what-the-rise-of-animated-gifs-means-for-content/">What the Rise of Animated GIFs Means for Content</a>, a delightfully serious look at the editorial strategy around animated GIFs. A year ago we were discussing GIFs as ascendant, six years ago we discussed GIFs as having <a href="/2006/07/zidane-world-cu">finally been worthy of artistic recognition</a> and a scant 23 years ago, they were just being invented. Progress!</li>
<li>David Jacobs ruminates on <a href="http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2012/08/nofomo.html">#NOFOMO</a>. I’d shared some of the same misgivings about that phrasing, but the concept is useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/benjaminj4/how-white-is-the-new-internet">Data on the country club</a> from Benjamin Jackson over at Buzzfeed. I like it as a data-driven view into the ideas I was exploring <a href="/2012/08/16/you-cant-start-the-revolution-from-the-country-club">a few weeks ago</a>.</li>
<li>Oh, and I had some fun talking to Microsoft’s Twitter account on they day they announced their new logo:</li>
</ul>

<p>Aaaaand I think that’s it. You all keep on writing, and I’ll do the same, and we’ll meet back here in a little while.</p>
