<p>Oh, there’s been lots of chatter on the Internet this week! Where all did our conversations show up? Well, I’ll tell you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pegged to the release of Jessica Valenti’s new book <a href="http://jessicavalenti.com/books/why-have-kids/">Why Have Kids</a>, I (somewhat inexplicably!) participated in an NY Daily News <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/kids-join-daily-news-a-google-hangout-author-jessica-valenti-truth-parenting-happiness-article-1.1151319">Roundtable via Google Hangout</a>, discussing the vagaries of parenthood and career with Jessica, Lenore Skenazy and Karen “Duff” Duffy. You know you’d like to watch my first time interacting with the former VJ, right?</li>
<li>Over on MetaFilter, <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/119525/Privately-Owned-Public-Spaces">Larry Roberts wrote about Privately-Owned Public Spaces</a>, a topic we just visited <a href="/2012/03/05/captive-atria-and-living-in-public">a few months ago</a>. I like the breadth of the resources he wrapped up in the discussion.</li>
<li>I was a judge for the Online News Association’s <a href="http://journalists.org/2012/08/29/2012-online-journalism-awards-finalists-announced/">Online Journalism Awards</a> this year. The slate of entrants was extraordinary, and the selected honorees even more so. Do go check them out.</li>
<li>How the hell did Reddit manage to grow and thrive after being left for dead by the Diggosphere and snapped up by Condé Nast? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/business/media/reddit-thrives-after-advance-publications-let-it-sink-or-swim.html?_r=1&amp;emc=tnt&amp;tntemail0=y">David Carr explored that topic</a> in the New York Times, and naturally I couldn’t shut up about it.</li>
<li>Our beloved animated gifs are a central part of fan culture. (Indeed, where would LiveJournal or Tumblr fanfic be without them?) and <a href="http://animationanomaly.com/2012/08/31/the-place-of-gifs-in-the-animated-fandom/#.UEWAZaSOqFd">Charles Kenny has the story</a>. I read the fanfic for the articles.</li>
<li>We reached our $5000 goal (and then some!) for the <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/p/campaign/?campaign_id=30080">charity: water campaign</a> I launched yesterday. Not only did we top $5000 in a little over 12 hours, we’ve <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/september/">vaulted to the top of the list</a> of campaigns as ranked by number of donors. Won’t you <a href="https://mycharitywater.org/p/donate?campaign_id=30080&amp;payment_amt=37#cc1">give $37</a> and become one, too?</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all for now! Let me know if I’ve missed any of my blabbing elsewhere; I wouldn’t want to deprive you.</p>
