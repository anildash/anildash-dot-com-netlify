<p>Oh, hello there! I didn’t see you come in. Well, as long as you’re here, let’s look at some links around the web that I’ve found to be related to what we’ve been talking about here.</p>
<ul>
<li>My August column for Wired, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/column-microsoft/">talking about Microsoft’s return to its freewheeling, slightly-evil days</a>, was a lot of fun to write, and has inspired some great responses. There’s this <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/13/dash">well-considered but fundamentally contrary response</a> from John Gruber, and I was going to take issue with <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1168129/macalope_fan_mail.html">The Macalope’s dissent</a> with the piece, but now it’s dead behind a firewall so I don’t have to. Ha ha!</li>
<li>Then, just a few days later, Wired put up my September column, calling for an <s>armed uprising</s> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/ts-column/"> organized set of protests</a> against abusive Terms of Service from the likes of Facebook and Cisco. I strongly believe that the constraints of our services’ TOS policies are far, far more important than the insular vagaries of API policy that the tech community likes to debate.</li>
</ul>
<p>For both of the Wired columns, I’ll publish DVD extras (links and source materials) soon, as I’ve done for my earlier pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/technology/cutting-the-digital-lifeline-and-finding-serenity.html?smid=pl-share">Jenna Wortham explored the Joy of Missing Out</a>, an exploration keying off of <a href="/2012/07/19/jomo/">my post a few weeks ago</a>. It’s a really wonderful to see such a thoughtful expansion on these ideas, and I enjoyed recording the accompanying video where we talked about the inspiration behind the story: My son Malcolm. (The story marks his first-ever media appearance. I couldn’t be more proud.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of recording interviews, I had a blast getting back in touch with Brent Leary the other day, and our conversation turned into an interview transcript which you can find on the <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2012/08/anil-dash-blogging-interview.html">Small Business Trends</a> site or on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/anil-dash-of-dashescom-blogging-and-business-then-and-now-2012-8">Business Insider</a>, though the former has audio of the full interview, if your’e interested. Naturally, after we got done talking about blogs and tech, we started talking about Prince and funk music in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh hey, remember when we all were offended by <a href="/2012/05/02/fixing_popchips/">Popchips making a racist ad</a>, but then I was all optimistic and tried to encourage them to do the right thing? Well, fool me twice, shame on me: <a href="http://blogs.ocweekly.com/stickaforkinit/2012/08/popchips_offensive_mexican_promotion.php">They’re at it again</a>. It’s a horrible, horrible feeling to think that the CEO of a company has really understood and tried to change his company’s culture, only to find out he actually doesn’t care if he’s exploiting offensive stereotypes as long as he’s selling more snack chips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By contrast, I love how <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the-future-of-streams-twitter-looms-as-biggest-obstacle.php">Richard MacManus offered a larger perspective</a> on the future of streams on the web, which builds on many of the ideas I was trying to articulate in <a href="/2012/08/14/stop_publishing_web_pages/">Stop Publishing Web Pages</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then finally, some fun pieces that key off of my tweets in the past few days. <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/27/housekeeping-how-many-hundreds-of-twitter-apps-have-you-authorized-how-many-do-you-remember/">Sarah Lacy at PandoDaily</a> asks what percentage of Twitter-connected apps are meaningful, after <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/240177736973447169">I asked on Twitter</a> how many apps people have connected to their accounts. And in a much more servicey vein, <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2012/08/19/a-quick-note-on-conspicuous-text-also-known-as-all-caps/">Luis Villa offers a detailed explanation</a> of why legal contracts still use ALL CAPS for many clauses, which I had <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/236482210352480256">wondered about</a> last week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it for now! I always feel so lucky that smart people like to respond to or include me in the conversation when they talk about ideas that pop up on this site.</p>
