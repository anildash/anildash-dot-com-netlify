<p>First, a bit of background: <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, Google’s venerable and pioneering blogging service was created in 1999 by a small team at Pyra Labs, as an offshoot of the project management platform they’d originally set out to make.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/c4e475b2-a54e-47e0-973c-ed0bd1b46262/GO0064.jpg?v=1670720599077" alt="" title="Blogger shirt"></p>
<p>As one of the earliest users of Blogger, I was always amongst the service’s biggest fans (and have been duly impressed by the new features introduced on Blogger lately). Pyra went through financial struggles, had a painful breakup of the original team, got back on its feet with a new team, and then finally sold to Google. And all of <em>that</em> happened more than nine years ago. Amazing how time flies!</p>
<p>In the years since, I’ve either remained or become friends with most of the folks who were involved in Pyra’s various incarnations, and so when I started to lament the lack of innovation and evolution in blogging software and platforms in recent years, that early crew came to mind as the first people to talk to about where we should be headed.</p>
<p>Thus, I present a discussion which became wonderfully fruitful, featuring <a href="http://evhead.com">Ev Williams</a>, <a href="http://megnut.com/">Meg Hourihan</a>, <a href="http://onfocus.com/">Paul Bausch</a> and <a href="http://metafilter.com">Matt Haughey</a>. Along with <a href="http://attribyte.com/people/Matt_Hamer">Matt Hamer</a>, they formed the core of the Blogger team at the time I fell in love with it thirteen (!) years ago. I think you’ll enjoy their conversation as much as others who’ve shared a link to it, ranging from Tim O’Reilly to Michael Arrington to Om Malik to Dave Winer.</p>
