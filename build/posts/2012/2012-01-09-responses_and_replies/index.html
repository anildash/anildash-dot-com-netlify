<p>A few nice conversations around the web, either in response to or inspired by what I’ve been talking about here:</p>
<ul>
<li>My favorite TechCrunch post in a long time is Jon Evans’ <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/scheming-intentions/">Scheming Intentions</a>, which outlines a simple way that native mobile apps could take a tentative step towards re-integrating with the web.</li>
<li>Shapeways, the delightful 3D printing-on-demand service wrote a <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/1147-Back-to-the-Future-3D-printing-and-the-rise-of-creative-commerce.html">deep and thoughtful</a> response to my ideas about <a href="/2011/12/3d-printing-teleporters-and-wishes">where 3D printing is headed</a>. BoingBoing had a <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/12/21/3d-printers-as-teleporters.html">quick take</a> on the post, too, and I found the comments entertaining.</li>
<li>I liked Michael Newman’s <a href="http://zigzigger.blogspot.com/2011/12/faves-2011.html">recap of his favorites from 2011</a>, especially his ruminations on animated .gifs.</li>
<li>I had a blast talking to Leo Laporte and Tom Merritt <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/35">on the Triangulation show</a> — I know spending the better part of an hour listening to me ramble is a lot, but I’m very proud of the conversation about blogging in the first half, and hope that justifies enduring this for some folks:</li>

<ul>
<li>A wonderful, deep look at the <a href="http://fixingthehobosuit.com/2012/01/own-yourself/">importance of owning your identity online</a>, detailed by Patric King, uses the comments on my <a href="/2012/01/03/foursquare-todays-best-executing-startup">recent post about Foursquare</a> in contrast to the comments on the piece was it was shared/republished on <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-no-startup-is-better-than-foursquare-when-it-comes-to-new-products/#comment-400194186">Facebook</a> and on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114042406/http://paidcontent.org/article/419-no-startup-is-better-than-foursquare-when-it-comes-to-new-products/#comment-400194186">PaidContent</a></li>
<li>I loved <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/07/internet-freedom_n_1133513.html">Rebecca MacKinnon’s stirring TED talk</a> asking people to take back the internet. Yes, let’s!</li>
<li>The fun app-as-nostalgia service <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a> has been getting some attention; <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/12/19/timehop/">Mashable’s piece</a> on the service uses my comments to demonstrate why it’s meaningful.</li>
<li>MetaFilter <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/21331/If-your-website-is-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault">revisits the principles of having a constructive community</a> and along the way re-legislates my advocacy around the idea that the site should do more to welcome new users.</li>
<li>Finally, an <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/video/fixing-government-anil-dash-on-a-social-media-revolution-for-policymakers/12575/">interview I did for PBS’s “Need to Know”</a> was <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/need-to-know-fixing-government-anil-dash-on-a-social-media-revolution/">excerpted on their site</a>; I think this brief clip highlights very well the challenge and opportunity that we see at Expert Labs to really have a positive impact on government. I don’t know if and when this airs in various locales, but hopefully this gives you a feel for the ideas.</li>
