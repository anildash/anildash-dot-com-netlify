<p>Iâ€™ve linked to it here before, but the <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~mjm/cgi-bin/ttsdemo">AT&amp;T Labs Interactive TTS Demo</a> is well worth checking out. TTS is Text to Speech, meaning you type in your (presumably naughty) phrase and the computer will say it.</p>
<p>Hours of safe, enjoyable fun for the whole family.</p>
