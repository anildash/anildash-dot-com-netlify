<p><a href="http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2001_01_01_archive.inc#1883368">Meg noticed more popups too</a>, which I had mentioned seeing <a href="/index.php?blogarch/2000_12_01_archive.php#1721995">a couple of weeks ago</a>. Funny thing is, there are pretty easy ways to take care of these, although I don’t use them, and everyone else I know is too lazy to use them. You can download an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/webaccess/pwrtwks.exe">IE5 Power Tweak</a> from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/IE/WebAccess/default.asp">Microsoft’s site</a> and it’ll add a right-click menu to IE5 on Windows that you can use to assign a site (Epicurious?) to the &quot;Restricted&quot; zone.</p>
<p>This works because, by default, sites in the Restricted zone can’t run any kind of scripting. I also made <a href="/tools/seczones.inf">this .inf file</a> which you can download to your desktop, and then right-click and choose &quot;Install&amp;quot. It’ll add a bunch of common web sites’ ad servers to your restricted list, preventing them from using Javascript for pop-ups. This one’s for IE5+ for Windows only, too. I’m on Win2K, so if the registry locations are different on Win9x, this won’t work. I don’t have a machine to test that on right now, though, so let me know.</p>
<p>If you want to see the list of sites blocked, look at the file in Notepad or something, or I can post a list here if anyone asks for it.</p>
