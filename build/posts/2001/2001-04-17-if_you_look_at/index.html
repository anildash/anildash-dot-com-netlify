<p>If you look at the &quot;buzz&quot; section on my <a href="http://www.dashes.com/portal/">portal</a>, you can see that I like to check up on what’s popular on the web. The only link on there that I regularly check is <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/mt/us/dailynews/?u">Yahoo’s Most Popular page</a>, and I’ve been able to tell from following the subjects or links of <a href="http://www.kottke.org/notes/0104.html#010412">other people’s blogs</a> that I’m not the only one. <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archived.blah/4/01/2001/#532">Rock Star</a> used his extensive study of the genre to create what he insists will become <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/junkdrawer/yahoo.jpg">THE MOST POPULAR YAHOO IMAGE EVER!!!</a></p>
<p>It’s a goofy example, but I’ve been intrigued for months with these sorts of things, and with observing the creation and dissemination of memes on the web. This has just been amplified by trying to help <a href="http://www.torrez.org">Andre</a> with the new version of <a href="http://www.filepile.org">FilePile</a>. Not to mention my ongoing obsession with <a href="http://www.metafilter.com">MeFi</a>.</p>
