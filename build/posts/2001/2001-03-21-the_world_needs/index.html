<p>Why is it that today, especially in music, we have to choose between entertainment, meaning <em>performance</em>, and sincerity, meaning <em>emotion</em>? It frustrates me to no end that nobody’s doing both anymore. I tend to have fleeting fondnesses for contemporary music, but nothing lasting, because it doesn’t lend itself to being both appreciated <em>and</em> enjoyed.</p>
<p>I guess the two extremes in popular music are the Radiohead/Britney Spears continuum. And I love both their musical styles, which really aren’t all that far apart. (Yes, yes, spare me the examples, there’s tons of other stuff out there that I listen to and love that’s much more underground, chock full of indie cred.) But I think it’s more likely that Britney will grow into making introspective, challenging music than that Radiohead will ever strive to put on a spectacle for my amusement.</p>
<p>And that’s a shame. Because it would make for a better end result. It would be Rock And Fucking Roll. I’ve never, ever, been one to say &quot;music was better back when…&quot; but I’m slowly becoming one of Those Guys. Not because there isn’t great music out there; There inarguably is. But no one wants to write it, record it, and most of all <em>play it</em> for me.</p>
<p>The Stones didn’t apologize about making great music. And they didn’t apologize about Mick strutting around with his tongue out to sell it. I dig that. Is there anybody doing both these days? <a href="mailto:anil@dashes.com">Remind me</a>. And don’t bother with your cousin’s really, really great stuff up on MP3.com. I’m sure it <em>is</em> genuinely good. But I want a <strong>Rock Star</strong>.</p>
