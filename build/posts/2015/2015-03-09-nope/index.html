<p>I’m a normal guy.</p>
<p>I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t smoke cigarettes. I don’t do any illegal drugs. I don’t drink coffee.</p>
<p>I never graduated from college. I’ve never been arrested.</p>
<p>I don’t regularly watch any TV shows. I don’t subscribe to any print magazines or newspapers. I don’t have a religion.</p>
<p>I don’t wear khaki pants. I don’t wear polo shirts. I don’t own a car. I don’t own a gun.</p>
<p>I don’t play any organized sports. I don’t belong to a political party.</p>
<p>I don’t think these are the only right choices. I don’t mind that you make different choices. I don’t accept that these choices are treated as strange. I don’t accept that not everybody is lucky enough to be able to make these choices. I don’t have a problem reminding people that these are all the default states that we are born with.</p>
