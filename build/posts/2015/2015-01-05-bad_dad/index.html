<p>Even though I’ve been having a lot of conversations recently about <a href="/2014/11/peak-dad-twitter">being a dad</a>, the truth is that on any given day what keeps me up at night is the things I’m getting wrong. I know every parent makes mistakes, and logically I am able to keep that perspective on it, but I also know every parent can recite the failings that make us feel sick to our stomachs just thinking about them.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyway, time to reset the &quot;It has been [0] days since feeling like the worst parent in the world&quot; sign!</p>&mdash; anildash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/552227791161556994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>So I should be clear that the reason I’m always thinking about parenthood and its obligations is <em>not</em> because I think I’m World’s Greatest Dad, but because it’s an unusual duty where those of us who take it on <em>never</em> really feel like we’ve mastered it.</p>
<p>It was with that spirit in mind that I went into the conversation with Kathryn Rotondo for the <a href="http://www.motherboardpodcast.com/episode-12-anil-dash/">Motherboard podcast</a> the other day. Typically, Kathryn speaks to women who are managing careers in technology while also raising their children. As a bit of a departure for the podcast, I was asked to give a little bit of a dad’s perspective.</p>
<p>Kathryn picked out a quote that I hadn’t quite realized was going to be a bit of advice to myself, a perspective that I’m trying to remember is true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only bad choice is for you to be a miserable parent, to not be present, to not be investing time as much as you can in your kid, or to not meet those basic needs—the biological-level needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal, as always, is that maybe each of us can screw up our kids just slightly less than the generations that came before. If you have a few minutes, I hope you’ll give the podcast a listen (you can also <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-12-anil-dash/id834761944?i=329745177&amp;mt=2">get it on iTunes</a>) and then offer your advice. Now I just have to figure out where I misplaced my kid…</p>
