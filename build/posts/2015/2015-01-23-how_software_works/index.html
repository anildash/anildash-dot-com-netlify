<p>Here’s a lesson in how software development works.</p>
<p>Say you’d like to port a popular arcade game to your home video console. You can give a guy like Tod Frye four months to do a good-enough version of Pac-Man. It’ll sell 7 million copies, even though it looks... not great.</p>
<p><em>Or</em>, you can wait for 30 years of refinement and improvement in understanding of Atari software development, give someone three years to develop their own version of Pac-Man and end up with a <a href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/229152-new-pacman-for-atari-2600/">near-flawless clone</a> of the arcade original.</p>

<p>It will sell zero million copies.</p>
