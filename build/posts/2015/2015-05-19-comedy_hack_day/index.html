<p>I was incredibly honored to asked by the team at Cultivated Wit to be a judge for the latest <a href="http://www.comedyhackday.org/nyc-2015/">Comedy Hack Day</a>. (Thus becoming the first-ever returning judge!) I got to join Michael Ian Black, Aparna Nancherla, and Christina Warren as a judge of an incredible lineup of ludicrously funny parade of completely inane apps.</p>
<p>Here, take a few minutes and enjoy Pizza Blaster, which won our special judges’ award for Best Delivery.</p>

<p>In a time when so many of us are so often critical of the tech industry for making things that are stupid, or that sound like they should be a joke, it’s incredibly refreshing to see people creating technology that actually <em>is</em> a joke.</p>
<p>Congratulations to grand prize winner “Got This Thing”, runner up “Days to Live” (I would totally use this app!) and all the other participants. I hope you all become billionaires for making technology that nobody needs.</p>
