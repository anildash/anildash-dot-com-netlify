<p>In the middle of this year, in observation of his retirement from Microsoft, I wrote <a href="/2008/06/bill-gates-and-the-greatest-tech-hack-ever">Bill Gates and the Greatest Tech Hack Ever</a>, one of my most popular posts and one that I’ve had a number of people personally mention to me that they appreciated.</p>
<p>So, I was delighted to see <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/admiring-bill-gates.html">Dale Doughtery’s appreciation of Bill Gates</a>. Dale’s my favorite blogger on O’Reilly’s popular Radar blog, and this post shows why: A keen focus on the implications and sustainability of our choices in the tech industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many ways, Gates represents the “best of us” — it’s not just what he’s doing but how he thinks about what he’s doing. He’s a curious geek. He wants to find interesting problems to solve. He believes that smart, self-motivated people working together can make a difference. Bill Gates reflects the best qualities of a generation that has grown up finding the innovative ways to apply science and technology to impact our everyday life in mostly positive ways.</p>

<p>Even better, as pointed out by <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/dale-dougherty-on-bill-gates.html">my friend and coworker Michael Sippey</a>, one of <a href="/2004/05/the-day-i-met-d">my heroes</a>, <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/">Dan Bricklin</a>, showed up and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090125224410/http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/admiring-bill-gates.html#comment-2049548">weighed in on the post</a> as well.</p>
