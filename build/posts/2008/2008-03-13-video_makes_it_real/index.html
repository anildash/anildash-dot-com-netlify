<p>After all of the fun with the Snoop Dogg video a little while back, I figured I’d include some videos that are a bit closer to home, both from this past weekend’s SXSW interactive festival.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/">Rocketboom captured the Battledecks competition</a>, where I was thrilled to have shared the stage with a number of really funny people in trying to improvise a presentation in front of slides we’d never seen before.</p>

<p>Then, the following day, <a href="http://cruftbox.com/blog/archives/001490.html">Mike Pusateri recorded a time lapse</a> of the <a href="/kick/">kickball game</a>.</p>

<p>I especially love the taco break there in the middle, when everyone runs to go eat breakfast tacos. Yum!</p>
