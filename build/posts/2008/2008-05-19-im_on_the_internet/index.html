<p>Because my name and my big ole’ head are sitting on top of this page, it’s probably not making the self-indulgence any worse to collect a few links to some recent places I’ve popped up online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131122193752/http://gawker.com/391246/your-twitter+stalking-power-list">Gawker recommended</a><a href="http://twitter.com/anildash">my Twitter account</a> as one to follow after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081006111003/http://youngmanhattanite.com/2008/05/dont-shoot-canary.html">Krucoff posted a list to Young Manhattanite</a> based on <a href="http://fimoculous.com/">Rex</a>‘s suggestions. The strange thing to me is that Gawker is (still!) such a presence in media circles in NYC that 6,000 people would actually <em>read</em> such a thing. Of course, they’re all just wannabees — real Gawker credit comes from having been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080605030524/http://gawker.com/news/chris-anderson/shades-of-launch-party-chris-anderson-and-anil-dash-11224.php">at the launch party</a> five years ago. I’m just sayin’. (For more, similarly inane insights, <a href="http://twitter.com/anildash">add me on Twitter</a>!)</li>
<li>I helped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080622093858/http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/">Charlene Li</a> (a.k.a. The Best Tech Industry Analyst) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080622114746/http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2008/03/how-i-made-833.html">save $8.33</a> by <a href="/2007/12/unsolicited-testimonial-clear-card">offering up my testimonial about the Clear card</a>. That’s enough to pay for a subscription to dashes.com for more than a year!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha">Mat Honan wrote a piece in Wired</a> about <a href="http://thebigwordproject.com/">The Big Word Project</a>, the scam website where people pay for words. My site shows up because it’s the link for the word “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616022740/http://www.thebigwordproject.com/search?word=purple">purple</a>“, even though I didn’t do it myself. I blame Mike.</li>
<li>CRN has a (really very good) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173253/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/207400714;jsessionid=EX21SA455BICUQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=1">look at what the technology industry wants from the Presidential candidates</a>, with responses from the likes of Bill Gates and Paul Otellini. Inexplicably, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173258/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/207400714;jsessionid=GGUUKCVWKQOVOQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=11">I’m in there, too</a>: “The No. 1 thing we want to see is elected officials use social networking tools online as a tool for governance and for leadership when in office, just as they do to get elected.” Basically, I am tired of politicians treating web communities as an ATM for their campaigns, instead of seeing the web as an opportunity for fixing government.</li>
<li>And last but certainly not least, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906134820/http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/details.asp?aID=10184&amp;">So What Do You Do, Anil Dash</a>“. It’s a really long interview with me by the folks at Mediabistro, in advance of my presentation at the <a href="http://www.mediabistrocircus.com/">Mediabistro Circus</a> event on Tuesday. If you know me, there’s probably few surprises, but I was happy to get the chance to articulate a lot of points that I otherwise don’t usually talk about explicitly. Most of all, I am really glad to help emphasize how vibrant the technology scene is here in New York City; My biggest goal in participating in these sorts of conferences here in New York is to show people that there’s a lot more going on with tech here than people might realize if they’re myopically focused on just Silicon Valley.</li>
