<p>One of my recurring fascinations is people creating works of art using common productivity software. <a href="/2007/08/office-tools-of-expression">Office Tools of Expression</a> as a review of this medium that I wrote last year, and <a href="/2004/04/excel-pile">Excel Pile</a> offered an overview back in 2004.</p>
<p>Today, the idea of using office software as a means of expression is popping up more and more frequently. Danielle Aubert released <a href="https://www.danielleaubert.info/16-months-worth-of-drawings-in-microsoft-excel/">16 Months Worth of Drawing Exercises in Microsoft Excel</a> about two years ago, as a fifty-dollar coffee table book offering exactly what the title suggests. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081006110512/http://writerresponsetheory.org/wordpress/2006/12/11/excel-and-artbooks/">Writer Response Theory</a> presented a terrific overview of the work at the time, as well as an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081006110416/http://writerresponsetheory.org/wordpress/2006/12/15/excelling-an-interview-with-danielle-aubert/">interview with Aubert</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started making Excel drawings, never spending more than 30-40 minutes on each one, and I tried not to get hung up on whether I was making non-representational versus representational versus abstract versus systems versus typographic drawings. I just made drawings about anything that I thought might be pleasing in some general way. After a while I started to copy one day’s drawing into a spreadsheet for the next day’s drawing because I found that that way the drawings could build on themselves and maybe become a bit more complex. But really my main objective when I began making them was to experiment with making ’small art’ – or the equivalent of my friend’s small poems – in Excel.</p>

<p>And then, for the holidays this year, the Google Docs team has gotten into the game. They’ve released “Collaborative Spreadsheet Art”, a winter-themed piece created by four artists working simultaneously in the web-based spreadsheet app. The introductory movie is only a minute long.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081217014421/google.com/google-d-s/holiday08.html">Google Docs holiday site</a> offers more insights into the creation of the work, including a look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081207162039/http://www.google.com/google-d-s/holiday08_bts.html">behind the scenes</a>. Now I’m just waiting for the various web-based art programs to make performance videos of people using their tools to do calculations and analyze data.</p>
<p>If you’re really taken with this stuff, my <a href="/2007/08/office-tools-of-expression">earlier post</a> gathers up a list of interesting links about office app art.</p>
