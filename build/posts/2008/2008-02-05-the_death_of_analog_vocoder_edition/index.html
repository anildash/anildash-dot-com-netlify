<p>One of the things that makes <a href="/2008/02/snoop-dogg-can-see-the-future">Snoop’s “Sensual Seduction” video</a> so compelling is his outstanding use of vocal effects. Let’s take a closer look, shall we?</p>
<p>In the video, Snoop makes liberal use of a breath tube on his keytar, an obvious homage to the talkbox made (in)famous by <a href="https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/california-loved/Content?oid=2145601">Roger Troutman</a> of Zapp fame. (If you don’t know and love the funk, then you at least know Roger from the hook to Tupac’s “California Love”.) Snoop even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080205141144/http://suckerfreeblog.mtv.com/2007/12/03/snoop-dogg-on-his-sensual-seduction-throwback-video/">even explicitly credits Troutman</a> in an MTV interview, along with the much-more-obvious nods in the video to Prince and Rick James.</p>
<p>The thing is, “Sensual Seduction” <em>doesn’t</em> use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_box">talkbox</a>, nor does it use a vocoder, which is a completely different instrument that often gets credit for the talkbox’s outbut. The vocoder is an amazing instrument; There’s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071027172007/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/vocoder/index.html">interesting background</a> on the technology in this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071023070533/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/">survey of milestones in electronic musical instruments</a>, and the good folks at O’Reilly will even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060707135121/http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/03/29/vocoder-tutorial-and-tips.html">tell you how to make your own</a>, if you’re so inclined. I’ve been hoping for the vocoder and talkbox to return to the top of the pop charts for a solid decade now (ever since “California Love”, really) and am somewhat chagrined that so much of the recent voice-distortion on pop singles is in the context of rather uninspired songs. But I digress.</p>
<p>Music today isn’t made by connecting breathing tubes to home-built contraptions. Instead, commercial music is made in Digidesign’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215211527/http://www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?langid=100&amp;navid=234&amp;itemid=28112&amp;ref=74-f">ProTools</a>. ProTools is to commercial audio what Photoshop is to commercial design: Platform, product, and verb. And the first, and signature tool for performing pitch-correction on ProTools was Antares’ <a href="http://www.antarestech.com/products/auto-tune5.shtml">Auto-Tune</a>. The fun part is, now that we’ve entered this brave new world of digital distortion of vocals, Auto-Tune isn’t just <em>correcting</em> pitch, it’s being used to arbitrarily alter them.</p>
<p>You know the rest. Cher’s “Believe”? Auto-Tune. Snoop’s “Sensual Seduction”? Auto-Tune. And <em>all of <a href="https://tpain.com">T-Pain</a>‘s career</em>? Auto-Tune. Now, it’s possible that some producers are using other software to perform similar pitch-correction/pitch-manipulation duties; There are even <a href="http://www.gvst.co.uk/gsnap.htm">free clones</a> of Auto-Tune’s functionality. But as often as not, the software that’s become synonymous with the effect is the one that’s responsible for the sound.</p>
<p>And so, another bit of analog sound-hacking makes way for its digital successor. Even if he’s using the latest software, I gotta give props to Snoop for honoring the low-tech inspiration.</p>

<li>Naturally, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0012C0G2C/2020-2">“Sensual Seduction” is available</a> as an MP3 on Amazon.com</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000ZMUV2K/2020-2">buy “California Love”</a> over on Amazon, too. No iTunes links because DRM is wack.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve written <a href="/tags/autotune/">a lot more</a> about Auto-Tune: Check out <a href="/2008/02/when-autotune-strikes">When Auto-Tune Strikes</a>, about the fact that T-Pain can’t sing, and <a href="/2008/02/last-of-the-autotune">Last of the Auto-Tune</a>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215115117/http://gawker.com/356223/the-ultimate-analysis-of-snoops-sensual-seduction">Gawker hailed</a> as the “ultimate analysis” of this phenomenon.</p>
