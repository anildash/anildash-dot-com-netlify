<p>I forgot to mention one point when I was <a href="/2008/07/lists-and-being-on-them">blathering about lists</a> earlier this week: The easiest way to get on them is by asserting, truthfully or not, that you don’t want to be on them.</p>

Or something.</p>
<p>It’s nice to be called nice, but it’s even better that people wrongly believe that I <em>am</em> nice. Thanks, Eliot!</p>
