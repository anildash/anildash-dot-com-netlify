<p>Dedicated readers will recall me <a href="/2008/02/when-autotune-strikes">obsessing over</a> and <a href="/2008/02/last-of-the-autotune">over-analyzing</a><a href="/2008/02/the-death-of-analog-vocoder-edition">Auto-Tune in pop music</a> earlier this year. It is, then, my pleasure to report that, thanks to the inestimable <a href="http://sashafrerejones.com/">Sasha Frere-Jones</a>, Auto-Tune analysis has gone legit. Behold, no less an authority than <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2008/06/09/080609crmu_music_frerejones?currentPage=all">the New Yorker weighs in on Auto-Tune</a>, especially T-Pain’s (ab)use of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This, roughly, is what happens: Auto-Tune locates the pitch of a recorded vocal, and moves that recorded information to the nearest “correct” note in a scale, which is selected by the user. With the speed set to zero, unnaturally rapid corrections eliminate portamento, the musical term for the slide between two pitches. Portamento is a natural aspect of speaking and singing, central to making people sound like people. A nonmusical example of portamento would be “up-speak,” a verbal tic common in some people under thirty. (Can you imagine the end of every sentence rising in pitch? Like a question?) Processed at zero speed, Auto-Tune turns the lolling curves of the human voice into a zigzag of right-angled steps. These steps may represent “perfect” pitches, but when sung pitches alternate too quickly the result sounds unnatural, a fluttering that is described by some engineers as “the gerbil” and by others as “robotic.”</p>
