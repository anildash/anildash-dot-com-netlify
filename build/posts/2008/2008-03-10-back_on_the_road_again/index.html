<p>Blogging’s been light because this part of March is the heart of the conference season for me, usually stretching for a few exhausting weeks on the road. My new goal this year was to take it a little easier, pace myself better, get more sleep and exercise, and then try to make the things I <em>do</em> participate in get enough focus that they’re done well.</p>
<p>That seems to be working out, especially as I come back to <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> for the first time in years. Some nice mentions in <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/sxsw-fun-with-p.html">Wired talking about my Battledecks presentation</a> (see also a <a href="http://rooreynolds.com/2008/03/07/sxsw-day-1-battledecks/">video clip</a> which captures most of the presentation), both <a href="http://valleywag.com/365529/sxsws-a-real-kick">Valleywag</a> and <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-13772_3-9889244-52.html">CNet</a> talking about this year’s amazingly-successful <a href="http://dashes.com/kick/">kickball game</a>, and a <a href="http://tweetscan.com/index.php?s=anildash&amp;u=">really</a><a href="http://tweetscan.com/index.php?s=anil+dash&amp;u=">amusing</a> bunch of conversations on Twitter that show just how much people like a pithy soundbite when participating in a panel. It’s been fun seeing everybody in person, but I can’t say I’m not ready to go home.</p>
