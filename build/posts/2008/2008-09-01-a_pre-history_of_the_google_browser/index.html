<p>Today, in a surprisingly botched announcement, Google announced Chrome, their upcoming open source web browser. The subject of a Google browser is something I’ve <a href="/2003/07/upon-the-demise">opined on</a> a few times over the years, but Jason Kottke’s compiled <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/09/google-chrome-google-browser">an even more comprehensive</a> overview of the conversations a few of us have been having for almost seven years.</p>
