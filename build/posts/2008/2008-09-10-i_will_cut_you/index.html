<p>Last Friday was my birthday. Hooray! I have a fantastic wife, so she treated me to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915045306/http://www.thebrooklynkitchen.com/web-store/classes/1041-916-tuesday-pig-butchering-class/">pig-butchering class</a> at <a href="http://www.thebrooklynkitchen.com/">The Brooklyn Kitchen</a>. I like meat, and I like being educated about what I eat and respecting the animals I consume. So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mylan">Tom Mylan</a> was a fantastic person to lead the evening: Knowledgeable and passionate about his work as a butcher, and (as his blog demonstrates well) able to articulate that in a way that’s approachable even to rank amateurs like me.</p>
<p>Even better, my wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080914005523/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/09/pig-butchering-class-at-the-brooklyn-kitchen-williamsburg-tom-mylan-pork-nyc.html">posted a great writeup</a> over on Serious Eats. There’s lots more info on other Brooklyn Kitchen classes and on Tom there. And as I’ve <a href="/2005/04/being-an-expert">mentioned before</a>, I love displays of true competence, especially in regard to knives. And Tom has a <a href="http://groceryguy.blogspot.com/2008/07/answers-knife.html">stellar post about choosing knives</a> which shows off exactly that kind of expertise.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of cuts of meat in a pig, as the diagram here shows. (That’s courtesy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork">Wikipedia page on pork</a>.) And if you, like me, want to see more examples of the process of breaking down a sizable animal, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fields/sets/72157604254578730/">Adam Fields has a full photo set</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/95231779@N00/2422004296/">The Brooklyn Kitchen’s Flickr account</a> has a photo set on the making of head cheese. Both of those photo albums are probably not for those squeamish about butchering.</p>

<p>I could ramble on about this forever, but we have about 15 pounds of fresh pork in the kitchen now, so there’s work to be done.</p>
