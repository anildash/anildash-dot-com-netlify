<p>As always, I am trying to be everywhere at once. Here’s where I’ve succeeded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dan Costa at PC Magazine offers a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_hGsvsL4vVwC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=pc+magazine+%22The+Micro+Threat+to+Facebook%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GYjsGmDLFU&amp;sig=ACfU3U0r5TFtZBfwzL4LWkWVUdEnzSqFmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjEsLjU59H8AhWyElkFHS8tDbUQ6AF6BAgIEAM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">look at the rise of micro social networks</a>. I get a nod there, but it’s more satisfying to see the idea itself take off. That’s an idea that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915220817/http://www.r21.org/">Chris</a> and I revisited at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081029074945/http://www.blogworldexpo.com/">BlogWorld</a> conference last week, along with a discussion of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081002024906/http://videos.webpronews.com/2008/09/29/blogworld-blogging-becoming-an-industry/">blogging becoming an industry</a>.</li>
<li>There’s a pleasantly inexplicable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081216042101/http://blog.internetnews.com/kcorbin/2008/09/silicon-alley-no-more.html">passing mention of me</a> in reference to the Web 2.0 Expo here in New York. In case it’s not been clear in the past, I am <em>delighted</em> that the tech industry in NYC is closely linked to other industries like media and finance. It gives us a useful perspective and makes tech companies in NYC wiser and less prone to falling into the echo chamber that frustrates me about a lot of Silicon Valley companies. And I never liked the name “Silicon Alley” anyway.</li>
<li>The South Asian Journalists Association invited me to participate in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081219070538/http://www.sajaforum.org/2008/09/webcast-the-sou.html">first of two conversations about the South Asian blogging community</a>. I thought a lot of the points raised were pretty interesteing, and am a big fan of the <a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/">SAJA blog</a>, so this was a lot of fun.</li>
<li>The less said about <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/09/anil-dash-remixes-the-freeconferencecallcom-hold-music.html">this</a>, the better. I’m looking at you, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/yacomink/hold-music-remix-v">Andy</a>.</li>
</ul>
