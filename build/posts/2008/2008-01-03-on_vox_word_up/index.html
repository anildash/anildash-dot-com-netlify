<p>There are a million reasons to post the video for Cameo's &quot;Word Up&quot;, but today I am sharing this with you because it features LeVar Burton Gettin' Funky!</p>

<p>LeVar is looking like a long-lost member of the Time, and you don't need a VISOR to know that's a sharp look! YES I DID JUST MAKE A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VISOR">VISOR</a> JOKE.</p>
<p>If you want to undo the extreme funkiness of this clip (Larry's sportin' the big red codpiece!) then you can inflict the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq5DNLyzwfU">Ko?n cover of this song</a> upon yourself. It's of the same quality you've come to expect from everything that Ko?ndoes! That's a nice way of saying they suck! Even Limp Bizkit is the fault of Ko?n, right down to the deliberate spelling error! That's dumber than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_umlaut">heavy metal umlaut</a>! There's a <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/umlaut.html">film</a> about heavy metal umlaut's wikipedia entry! I can't stop shouting about this awful band! I wish I were a wolf so I could gnaw off my own paw<img src="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq5DNLyzwfU" alt="">
