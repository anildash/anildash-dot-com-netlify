<p>Right now I am here, but soon I may be somewhere near you! Let’s see where I’ve been lately, and where I’m going to be:</p>
<p>Across the internets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105172511/http://www.choiresicha.com/interviews/oh_man_i_just_realized.html">Choire asked a ridiculous question of mine</a> to <a href="http://www.wendyandlisa.com/">Wendy and Lisa</a> when he <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-ca-conversation3-2008aug03,0,852211.story">interviewed them for the LA Times</a>. <a href="http://idolator.com/399934/did-wendy--lisa-kickstart-pop+cultural-lesbian-chic">Michaelangelo picked this up</a> on Idolator, and I think my work is done here.</p>
<p>Absurdly, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090218222727/http://www.playboy.com/blog/2008/09/st-paul-the-belly-of-the-barracuda.html">offhand comment about Rudy Giuliani</a>, the <em>former Mayor of New York City</em> who likes to mock people for being “too cosmopolitan”, got quoted on the Playboy blog. Did you know Playboy has a blog?</p>
<p>And my presentation from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090123194043/http://www.mediabistro.com/circus/">Mediabistro Circus</a> back in May is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610113359/http://www.mediabistro.com/blogging-53-ondemandvideo.html">now available on video</a>, confirming once again that it’s incredibly painful to watch oneself on video.</p>
<p>I’m also looking forward to a bunch of upcoming events.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m proud to have helped out a little bit with <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexny2008/public/content/home">Web 2.0 Expo New York</a>. Frankly, we have an amazing tech scene here in NYC (<a href="http://www.sixapart.com/jobs">Six Apart is hiring!</a>) and we haven’t done enough to get recognition for it from the tech world at large. That’s why I’m quoted on the Expo site saying, “Well, it’s about  time.” Heh.</li>
<li>Next weekend in Las Vegas, I’ll be joining Chris Alden, our CEO at Six Apart, in a keynote presentation at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430133248/http://www.blogworldexpo.com/">Blog World Expo</a>. If you’ll be there Saturday morning, come see us, or find me at the event before or after.</li>
<li>Finally, next month, I’ll be in Greensboro, North Carolina for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081217020728/http://2008.convergesouth.com/">ConvergeSouth</a>. I am sure there will be many interesting things to do and see there, but my first priority is to get some barbeque. I’m sure y’all understand.</li>
</ul>
