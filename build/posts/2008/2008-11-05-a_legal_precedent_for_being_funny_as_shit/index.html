“Gollywaddles!”</p>
<p>Solicitor General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_G._Garre">Gregory G. Garre</a> (no seriously, his initials are “GGG”!) aspires to the title of Most Ridiculous Person In The World today with his impressive and absurd display of intellectual dishonesty, as quoted in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/washington/05scotus.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">New York Times article</a> today on the Supreme Court’s reconsideration of profanity on television:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The world that the networks are asking you to adopt here today, where the networks are free to use expletives,” said Gregory G. Garre, the solicitor general, may include “the extreme example of Big Bird dropping the F-bomb on ‘Sesame Street.’ ”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s Big Motherfuckin’ Bird, people! It’s Oscar the Bitch! (No Elmo.)</p>
<p>Additional delights in this story abound, with the image of the supreme justices throwing around all kinds of euphemisms for common expletives, and even culminating in what I sincerely hope becomes the law of the land: <strong>Any joke is okay, as long as it’s sufficiently funny.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Justice John Paul Stevens suggested a novel standard for judging indecency. Is it ever appropriate to consider, he asked, “whether the particular remark was really hilarious — very, very funny?”</p>
<p>Mr. Garre said funniness could play a part in the commission’s analysis of whether a remark was shocking, titillating or pandering. Justice Scalia jokingly summarized the new standard: “Bawdy jokes are O.K. if they are really good.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a new day, people. A new day.</p>
