<p>Having been blogging for a few years, I’ve developed a few annual traditions. This one’s a favorite: Warning you off of lame April Fool’s jokes on the web. Every year, I get called a curmudgeon, or lambasted for having no sense of humor. And every year, the jokes online get lamer and lamer.</p>
<p>I’d mentioned that <a href="/2006/03/your-april-fool">Your April Fool’s Day Joke Sucks</a> two years ago, revisited the idea <a href="/2007/04/your-april-fool-1">last year</a>, and have been proud to have been joined in my assessment by luminaries such as <a href="http://joshua.schachter.org/2008/03/stupid-internet-joke-day.html">Joshua Schachter</a> and <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2006/03/31/internet.shtml">Andy Baio</a> in taking a critical eye at this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The exception, of course, is if you’re doing something truly hysterical or on a magnificent scale. But I fear we won’t run into too many of those.</p>
