<ul>
<li><strong>September 10, 2013:</strong> As key members of the tech industry and trade press gather on a clear Tuesday morning, Tim Cook leads much of Apple’s senior management in the introduction of a simple, wearable touchscreen device. Priced around $300, it immediately attracts complaints that it’s too expensive, since wearable fitness devices are less than half the price; Supporters claim its support for a tightly-defined app platform differentiates it enough to justify the higher price.</li>
<li><strong>September 10-11, 2013:</strong> Key members of the tech blogosphere and Apple analysts weigh in on the new device. John Gruber offers 900 words essentially explaining that this is just a first version of the watch, so it’s okay that it’s very simple since it will gain features later. MG Siegler raves effusively about it, but his TechCrunch post is strikingly abbreviated, leading industry insiders to speculate his knowledge of Google’s hardware roadmap has led him to rein in his enthusiasm. Frank Shaw gamely tries to remind people of the Spot watch, declaring that Microsoft has always been interested in wrist-based PCs.</li>

<li><strong>October 18-20, 2013:</strong> Through the first weekend of its availability, various gadget aficionados weigh in on the experience of using the device. Marco Arment is very optimistic about the device as an app platform, but pronounces the first version a mixed bag as it only works with the limited edition imported luxury car he drives during the day, not the one he drives at night.</li>
<li><strong>October 22, 2013:</strong> Less than a week after launch, Apple’s perennial inability to make software that properly handles timezones pops up again, earning iWatch its first late night talk show mentions as Jay Leno bumbles through a punchline about “at least it’ll tell you when it’s time to upgrade!”</li>

<li><strong>February 3, 2014:</strong> After months of rumors that they were considering buying Jawbone, Samsung announces its acquisition of FitBit as an entry into the watch space.
