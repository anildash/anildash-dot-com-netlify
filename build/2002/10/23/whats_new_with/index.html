    <p>Hey, everyone, it‚Äôs my last post on <a href="/index.php?archives/003738.php">all this foolishness</a>. I‚Äôd like to get back to the fun stuff. First, a tremendous thank you to everyone who‚Äôs emailed, linked or IMed me in the last few days. I‚Äôve learned a lot and am quite pleased overall with the end results of what‚Äôs transpired. After replying to every one of the emails I‚Äôve gotten so far, and visiting sites where the topic‚Äôs been discussed, I think I‚Äôve had a chance to talk to people on all sides of this issue, and it‚Äôs been engaging, illuminating and educational.</p>
<p>To break it down to raw stats, I sent about 150 emails and read or wrote comments on about 35 websites, and I had 4 people apologize, 3 or 4 begrudgingly afford me their respect, and most satisfyingly, 7 people who changed their minds. I couldn‚Äôt really have asked for a better response. Another handful of people told me that they read LGF for the news and links but were afraid to voice the same objections I had for fear of facing, well, what I did.</p>
<p>Charles posted his <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=4510">last word</a> on the subject, including a reference to the fact that on one thread I called him a racist in the heat of anger based on having read a different version of the text being discussed at the time. Though I didn‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúretract‚Äù, I did <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=4166#c0100">retract my statement</a> as soon as I realized my error. I had assumed, apparently incorrectly, that when I said yesterday &quot;But let me be clear. I don‚Äôt think Charles is a racist.&quot; that it was clear that I was saying I don‚Äôt think Charles is a racist. Some of the same people who missed that point may have missed the implicit üôÇ smiley after my invitation to kiss my big brown butt. I had thought that would be obvious as well, as my butt is not very big.</p>
<p>Regrettably, I had to turn off comments on that discussion. It had devolved into a shouting match between people who had long since lost sight of whatever points they were ostensibly trying to make. But I do think these are important topics that are worth discussing, and it‚Äôs been fascinating just from an objective standpoint to watch the sociology and human dynamics involved in all of this.</p>
<p>As a show of good faith that I‚Äôm still interested in engaging in a dialogue with anyone interested in this topic, I‚Äôd like to offer some future ways to talk to me about this, as I won‚Äôt be posting about it on my site anymore. Anyone who‚Äôs interested in discussing these topics can, of course, email me at <a href="mailto:anil@dashes.com">anil@dashes.com</a> or IM me on any of the major instant messaging services at the name anildash or call me at +1 917 892 5519. I can‚Äôt promise I‚Äôll answer that phone right away, as I don‚Äôt usually take calls while I‚Äôm working, but if you leave a message, I‚Äôll call you back.</p>
<p>Also, anyone who is a regular visitor or commenter on Little Green Footballs who is, or will be, in downtown Manhattan in the next month is welcome to contact me via one of those methods if they want to meet up for drinks or coffee, on me. If there‚Äôs enough response, we‚Äôll put together a dinner, my treat. And we don‚Äôt have to talk about any of this stuff, we can talk about the potential and future of weblogs as a medium, or discuss the finer points of soul music, or whatever you‚Äôre interested in. Mr. Taranto, if you‚Äôre still reading, the offer still applies, but you have to pay for your own drinks.</p>
<p>I look forward to your responses, and thanks again to everyone for taking part in the conversation.</p>
