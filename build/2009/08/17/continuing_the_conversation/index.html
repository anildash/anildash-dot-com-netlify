  <main class="post__content">
    <p>Phew! Seems like there are a ton of people talking about the topics we’ve all been discussing here lately. Here’s some highlights:</p>
<h3>Startup.gov</h3>
<p>After I <a href="/2009/08/the-most-interesting-new-tech-startup-of-2009.html">posited that the U.S. executive branch is the most interesting startup of 2009</a>, there have been some amazing responses. <a href="http://www.cnewmark.com/2009/08/anil-dash-online-govt-the-best-startup-of-2009.html">Craig Newmark</a> (you love his list!) very kindly gave a nod towards my post, adding “In some results, it’s run like a really good Silicon Valley startup”, and spreading the word on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-newmark/anil-dash-online-govt-the_b_260384.html">The Huffington Post</a> as well. Mike Masnick at Techdirt <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090817/0133175896.shtml">chiimed in as well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For plenty of reasons that you can guess, I’m pretty jaded by people in government, and it’s rare to come across people who seem to be doing things for anything other than “political” purposes. But I have to admit that the amazing thing that came through in both [Federal CTO Aneesh] Chopra’s talks was that they were both entirely about actually getting stuff done, with a focus on openness and data sharing. Chopra talked, repeatedly, about figuring out what could be done both short- and long-term, and never once struck me as someone looking to hoard power or focus on a partisan or political reason for doing things. It was never about positioning things to figure out how to increase his budget. In fact, many of the ideas he was discussing was looking at ways to just get stuff done now without any need for extra budget. Needless to say, this is not the sort of thing you hear regularly from folks involved in the government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of my essay, I’d pointed out one particular challenge that faces this new startup-minded government effort: “Acquiring and retaining talent is hard, especially in a city that doesn’t have as deep a well of people with tech startup experience.” Amazingly, the latest perfect example of the type of talent that are heading to D.C. these days just popped up, with <a href="http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2009/08/going-fed.html">Christopher Soghoian’s announcement</a> that he is joining the FTC. I only know Christopher’s work by reputation at Harvard’s Berkman Center, but I think the fact that the government is looking for talented people in academia (a talent pool that typical tech startups often overlook) is a great sign.</p>
<p>Of course, there are skeptics. <a href="http://www.gnagesh.com/">Gautham Nagesh</a> covers the government for <a href="http://nextgov.com/">Nextgov</a> and Atlantic Media, and he thinks I’m <a href="http://twitter.com/gnagesh/status/3362984105">believing the hype</a>“. Of course, I think Gautham and I just disagree about government’s role in general, and that I’ll take small signs of progress as successes, even if there is a lot of work left to do yet.</p>
<p>In fact, I’ll be talking about this a bit later today on <a href="http://www.federalnewsradio.com/index.php?nid=18&amp;sid=1553778">Federal News Radio’s Daily Debrief show</a>. If you’re in D.C., tune in to 1500 AM at 4:05 EDT and one idea I’ll be discussing is how the recent web achievements by the executive branch are a lot like Microsoft’s recent success with <a href="http://bing.com/">Bing</a>; It doesn’t mean that the whole giant organization is on the right track, it just means that it’s still <em>possible</em> for these behemoths to do the right thing.</p>
<p>The potential is also hinted at in <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/08/data-is-journalism-msnbc-acqui.html">Brady Forrest’s post about EveryBlock’s acquisition</a> over on O’Reilly Radar. I’m ecstatic to see Adrian and his team at EveryBlock get even more resources for their work, but just as pleased to see the government’s work being discussed as a peer to even the most cutting-edge startups in the private sector.</p>
<h3>Google’s Wave Moment</h3>
<p>After my recent posts about <a href="/2009/08/what-works-the-web-way-vs-the-wave-way.html">The Wave Way</a> and <a href="/2009/07/googles-microsoft-moment.html">Google’s Microsoft Moment</a>, I was very graciously invited to join Leo Laporte, Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis on their awesome podcast about Google and cloud computing, <a href="http://twit.tv/twig3">This Week in Google</a>. If you have an hour or so to spare for listening to a podcast, I am very proud of how it came out, and especially that I got to participate with such pros on a show like this. TWiG is available on iTunes and Boxee and all of those usual services as well.</p>
<p>The idea that Google is facing a reckoning as it grows in size and influence seems to have caught on, and comparing the company to Microsoft has gone from seeming a bit radical at the time I posted to becoming much more popular when <a href="/2009/07/more-on-googles-microsoft-moment.html">Wired covered the idea</a> to finally having become something approaching conventional wisdom in just a few weeks. Take, for example, <a href="http://www.techflash.com/microsoft/The_new_Google_is_the_old_Microsoft_52839567.html">New Google is the old Microsoft</a>, by Galen Ward, which lists the ways that Google ties its nascent (or even unsuccessful) efforts to the results of its dominant search engine.</p>
<h3>Apple Blinks on Secrecy?</h3>
<p>Less than three weeks ago, I was arguing that <a href="/2009/07/apple-secrecy-does-not-scale.html">Apple’s culture of secrecy can’t scale</a>. Fortunately, we may never know if I’m right. Astoundingly, Apple has opened up to some degree, most notably via VP Phil Schiller reaching out personally to bloggers <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store">John Gruber</a> and <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/160726521/on-saturday-night-we-drove-up-to-seattle-to">Steven Frank</a>. Of course, that’s not a complete course change for Apple, but it is still significantly more human, personal and open than any recent communications they’ve made about their efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the idea that Apple’s traditional secrecy is untenable has gotten an even larger audience with <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6797859.ece?token=null&amp;print=yes&amp;randnum=1250612519467">The Times’ lengthy look at Steve Jobs and Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]long with computers, iPhones and iPods, secrecy is one of Apple’s signature products. A cult of corporate omerta — the mafia code of silence — is ruthlessly enforced, with employees sacked for leaks and careless talk. Executives feed deliberate misinformation into one part of the company so that any leak can be traced back to its source. Workers on sensitive projects have to pass through many layers of security. Once at their desks or benches, they are monitored by cameras and they must cover up devices with black cloaks and turn on red warning lights when they are uncovered. “The secrecy is beyond fastidious and is in fact insultingly petty and political,” says one employee on the anonymous corporate reporting site Glassdoor.com, “and often is an impediment to actually getting one’s work done.”</p>
<p>But employees are one thing; shareholders are another. Should Jobs (who, as far as the world is concerned, is Apple) have been allowed to conceal the seriousness of his illness? Warren Buffett, the greatest investor alive, doesn’t think so. “Whether [Steve Jobs] is facing serious surgery or not is a material fact.”</p>
<p>Some say another sign that Apple omerta has gone too far was the death of Sun Danyong, a 25-year-old employee of Foxconn, a Chinese manufacturer of Apple machines. He was given 16 prototypes of new iPhones. One disappeared. Facts beyond that get hazy, but it is clear that Sun committed suicide by jumping from a 12th-storey apartment. Internet babble says he killed himself because of the vanished prototype and, therefore, because of Apple’s obsessive secrecy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pushing the Right Buttons</h3>
<p>Finally, the idea of <a href="/2009/07/the-pushbutton-web-realtime-becomes-real.html">the Pushbutton Web</a> seems to be gaining steam. I am delighted to point out Om Malik’s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/08/13/the-evolution-of-blogging/">The Evolution of Blogging</a>, which Om uses as an example of a longer-form blog post he’s enjoyed recently, but which I also hope will be a catalyst for the evolution of blogging that he’s calling for in the post overall.</p>
<p>That point is taken even further with <a href="http://www.slate.com/toolbar.aspx?action=print&amp;id=2225283">Farhad Manjoo’s ruminations</a> in Slate, which reference my Pushbutton post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]s technologies like PubSubHubbub proliferate around the Web, with companies like Google, Facebook, and others embracing them, real-time Web updates will become the norm. It won’t be hard to build competitors to Twitter—systems that do as much as it does but whose decentralized design ensures that they’re not a single point of failure. Winer envisions these systems coming up alongside Twitter—when you post a status update, it could get sent to both Twitter and whatever decentralized, next-gen Twitter gets created. If these new systems take off, Twitter would be just one of many status-updating hubs—and if it went down, there’d be other servers to take its place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing so many great conversations pop up recently around the topics I’ve been obsessing over has been very inspiring; Right after I made <a href="/2009/08/but-wait-theres-more.html">offhand mention</a> of one of my <a href="http://bigthink.com/anildash">Big Think</a> interviews being about <a href="http://bigthink.com/anildash/the-philology-of-lol-cats">the Philology of LOLcats</a>, my original piece on LOLcat language, <a href="/2007/04/cats-can-has-gr.html">Cats Can Has Grammar</a>, was indirectly cited in <a href="http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1916286,00.html">Time’s profile of “I Can Has Cheeseburger”</a>, through a reference to “kitty pidgin”. It might seem like a minor mention, but the idea that a random dude like me can write a post that results in a phrase showing up in Time or <a href="/2009/08/on-fail.html">The New York Times</a> is still very exciting to me, after all of these years.</p>
<p>Best of all, there have been a spate of <em>amazing</em> comments on all of these posts lately, both on this site and in some of the responses I’ve linked to above. I’m having more fun than ever in watching the conversation across the blogosphere.</p>
<p>In the meantime, two to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slowweb.tumblr.com/">Slow Web</a>: “There’s a web that well-considered and worth savoring. We’ll show you where.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/08/13/everyFridayRainOrShine.html">Every Friday, Rain or Shine</a>: “When you see an interesting idea expressed in 140 chars that you think could use elaboration, ask them to do a longer-form post to explain. Especially on Fridays.”</li>
</ul>
