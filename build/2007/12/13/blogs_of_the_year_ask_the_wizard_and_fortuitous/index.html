    <p><strong>Today’s Blog of the Year Picks:</strong> <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/">Ask the Wizard</a> and <a href="http://fortuito.us">Fortuitous</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fortuitous-screen.gif" alt="fortuitous"></p>
<p>Between these two blogs, there have barely been twenty posts this year. Yet either one alone could be the best small-business (or small <em>tech</em> business) site of the year. Dick Costolo, co-founder and CEO of FeedBurner (now part of Google) writes Ask the Wizard, and Matt Haughey, proprietor of MetaFilter, is behind Fortuitous. Both these guys are a little too busy running their businesses to post more often than they do, but I’ll take what I can get. And both are creative, funny, honest writers whose openness and candor are inspiring.</p>
<p>Ask the Wizard is about the financial and organizational building blocks for creating and launching a company that is venture-backed and designed for growth. Dick’s done what a lot of tech entrepreneurs consider the holy grail, starting up a little tech firm, getting some first-rate funding, and then flipping it to Google. He and his team even did it in <em>Chicago</em>, of all places. And it’s not the first-time this team’s built a successful company. (Shout out to Spyonit!) So there’s a level of credibility and experience here that goes way beyond the endless sea of would-be tech business pundits who are mostly just talking out their asses.</p>
<p>And from the side of the independent entrepreneur who worked his ass off for years and self-funded a business into being a nice little stable company with a great set of ethics, nobody’s got better credentials than Matt Haughey. MetaFilter has grown from one of the earliest and most influential group blogs into a whole network of related sites, including Ask MetaFilter, which I <a href="/2006/12/matt-haughey-beat-google.html">raved about last year</a> for beating Google and for being one of the best sites on the web. Appropriately, Matt’s not talking about venture capitalists and boards of directors — he’s talking about the nuts and bolts of starting up a company and running it every day. And this stuff can be downright nerve-wracking, since there isn’t exactly a school you can go to for this kind of stuff. If you have a little company, tasks like talking to the press and hiring an accountant are the kind of things that can keep you up for a lot of long, sleepless nights. So Matt walks through his own process of how he figured those things out, accompanied by a remarkable honesty about the intimidating situations and neophyte’s mistakes he encountered along the way.</p>
<p>Best of all, both of these guys are great storytellers. You don’t have to be an entrepreneur or a geek to get into the narrative of what they’re saying; It’s just a really modern retelling of a story as old as the American dream.</p>

<p><strong>If you like this, try:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080217185908/http://blog.pmarca.com/">blog.pmarca.com</a>. Worst name ever for an amazingly good blog. Marc Andreessen should have been blogging, oh, about ten years ago. But I guess <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">he was busy</a>. He’s made up for lost time with an astoundingly frequent set of posts that are up-to-the-minute in their topicality but informed by the fact that no matter what part of the geek business world you’re in, he’s done it bigger, louder, and earlier. I usually try to play it cool with the name-dropping and the fanboyism, and I’m very fortunate that I get to meet and work with a lot of my inspirations, but I’m not ashamed at all to admit that I was totally geeked out to see <a href="/2007/10/rainman-blackbird-facebook-and-the-new-tables">one of my posts</a> referred to by Marc as “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080229063659/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/11/report-from-the.html">the smartest thing anyone has said today</a>“, even if it was only in the context of Open Social.</p>
