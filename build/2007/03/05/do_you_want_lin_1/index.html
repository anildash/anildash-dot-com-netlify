<li>Reyhan Harmanci on the <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/03/05/DDG3MOE3041.DTL&amp;type=printable">third wave of academic study of hip hop</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Dominant, a UC Berkeley alumnus who actually attended the much-publicized class on Shakur in the late ’90s, says that he finds value in hip-hop studies, provided they take the long view. “With hip-hop and all black music, you can’t talk about the art separate from a lot of other things,” he says. “You can’t talk about hip-hop as an art form without talking about the people, the economics, how and why it was made. You have to be pretty thorough.”</p>
<p>Finding ways to teach and study hip-hop from within a university setting is not easy. “I worry that scholars like us get so obsessed with trying to justify hip-hop that we end up running in circles,” says Berkeley grad student Felicia Viator, a DJ who’s finishing up a doctorate in history.</p>

<li>Businessweek’s Catherine Holahan <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070306_588600.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily">looks at the unfiltered conversations</a> that have sprung up in light of community changes after USA Today’s recent web redesign. I don’t know that I’d make a change in the cultural assumptions of a site at the same time as aesthetic/UI changes, because then you don’t know which one caused everybody to lose their minds.</li>
<li>Speaking of which, I <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White">started a shitstorm</a> by suggesting that Ask MetaFilter should have a white background. My personal experience is that the site <em>is</em> white, since I’ve customized my account, but I didn’t, uh… make a very good case that it should be the default because I was a bit uncharacteristically combative. On the other hand, I learned I’m <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392099">a twit</a>, a <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392223">shrill, self-promoting, a-list retard</a> who’s <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392220">not good at building community</a>, <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392198">more than out of touch</a>, prone to <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392120">issuing stridently absurd protestations</a>, deserved of <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392095">getting pissed on by an elephant</a>, who is only <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392031">being taken seriously … because [I’m] friends with Matt Haughey</a> and I’m encouraging <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392004">selling out</a>. One of my toughest critics in the thread had actually proposed a winning redesign in a contest on the site, an entry that featured a white background and <em>was voted the winner</em> by the entire community. I don’t know why people think the blogosphere is an unfriendly place, when an honest suggestion to <em>change the background color</em> on one subsite of a popular community blog that <a href="/2006/12/11/how_matt_haughe">I’m a huge fan of</a> can inspire those kinds of delightful, well-considered reactions. At least there was only one vague threat of violence.</li>
<li>I was surprised to find <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20012352,00.html">a list of Fall Out Boy’s favorite albums</a> to be somewhat interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/">Ask the Wizard</a>, written by Feedburner CEO Dick Costolo is, flat out, the best new blog of 2007. The thing I love about great writing is it makes the pervasive truths seem self-evident and even obvious. Plus it’s <em>actually</em> funny, not another tech exec wearing a goofy tie and claiming to be full of ha-ha.</li>
<li>There was a lot of link love for the <a href="http://gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/ugliest-buildings-in-new-york-according-to-the-experts-238431.php">list of NYC’s ugliest buildings</a> on Gridskipper, but the overlooked gem was the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/skyline/articles/050502crsk_skyline">pan of the Astor Place Monster</a> from the New Yorker a few years back. Man, that thing still startles me (in a bad way!) every time I walk by.</li>
<li>Dear Drew, have you considered changing the font on Fark’s homepage?</li>
<li>This is the old <a href="http://sunsite.nus.edu.sg/pub/humour/5perclgt.gif">Top 5% of all Web Sites</a> graphic that used to be used by Point. Which was actually Point Communications, which was actually at pointcom.com, until it sold to Lycos during a period of the web’s history 10 years ago that is apparently so old nobody caught the reference. Winning the meaningless award used to be <a href="http://www.spotsylvania.k12.va.us/NSPT/nsptop5.htm">accompanied by an email</a> alerting you to the good news. I suspect Todd Whitney is not still toiling away at Lycos.</li>
<li><a href="http://slumbering.lungfish.com/?p=327">Indie rock is a cult of failure</a>. Could be worse, it could be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri6ySOHoDfk">emo</a>.</li>
<li>I spoke at the Northern Voice conference in Vancouver a little over a week ago, and there’s <a href="http://northernvoice.podcastspot.com/episodes/FF8767">video of my presentation</a> up on the web, albeit with suboptimal sound. But it kind of gives you a feel for what we were all talking about, if you have the patience to sit through it. (My part starts about five minutes in.)</li>
<li>I wanted to be uniformly supportive of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/fashion/04asians.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin">the Times story about the struggle of Asian pop acts</a>, but I’d felt kind of conflicted and couldn’t articulate why. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.sajaforum.org/2007/03/media_watch_nyt.html">Sree Sreenivasan articulated it concisely</a>: We’re Asians too, dammit.</li>
<li>If you’ve somehow missed them, a few articles on the tech generation gap. <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/27341/index.html">Emily Nussbaum’s excellent, definitive look</a> at the distinctions between the technological expectations of those born before and after 1977 in regard to privacy seems like the coming-out party for the topics <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">danah</a> has been talking about forever. A simpler, but still compelling, <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=202251,00.asp">Tim Bajarin piece</a> in PC Magazine complements it nicely. And the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/03/AR2007030300978.html">WaPo sez</a> colleges have lost track of students because the schools are still trying to use phones and email to talk to kids who only use Facebook and IM. Whoops.</li>
<li>Here, take this: <a href="http://www.beastieboys.com/remixers.php">A capella Beastie Boys vocals</a> from some of their best tracks.</li>
<li>Remind me to run all of this through <a href="http://danieltsadok.net/cliche_detector.php">the Cliché Detector</a> later.</li>
<li>Someday, me and <a href="http://nymag.com/movies/profiles/28866/index.html">Kal Penn</a> in a steel cage match for Most Famous Indian in America. Someday.</li>
